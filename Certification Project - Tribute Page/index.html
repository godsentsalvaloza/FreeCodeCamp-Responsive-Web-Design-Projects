        <h2>Here's information about Martin Rauch's career.</h2>
        <div id="tribute-info"> 
          <p class="tribute-text">Martin is a 24 year old man living in East Germany with his mother, who is on the list for a kidney transplant. He is enlisted by his aunt Lenora and her boss Walter Schweppenstette to act as a spy in the West under the identity of Moritz Stamm, the aide-de-camp of General Wolfgang Edel, who is gunned down by an assassin on a train. </p>
          <p class="tribute-text">While he is over the border his girlfriend Annett learns she is pregnant with his child while engaging in an affair with a work colleague, who is later sent to the West as punishment after she reveals to Schweppenstette that he has been distributing banned books.  </p>
          <p class="tribute-text">Martin returns to the East after his mother has been moved up the donor list and donates his kidney to her but then returns to the West to continue his mission. After his cover is blown, he goes on the run while it is revealed that Schweppenstette is his biological father. However, he returns home to be with his mother. </p>
